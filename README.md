# Data Visualization Project

## Data 
The data I propose to visualize for my project is [US Police Shootings dataset](https://gist.github.com/Jogging97/6382acd43de16bccfe0cabe1c515c856)

## Prototypes
![prototype1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49541914/94445765-d5850c80-0175-11eb-88bc-f6e98c58e9c2.png)

## Questions & Tasks 

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:
* How does police shooting distribute along the US.
* Is there any correlation between race and shootings?
* Are there interesting patterns in armed?


## Sketches

2nd Sketch is trying to show the shooting numbers with respect to the age <br/>
3rd Sketch is trying to show the plotbox about age and race  

## Schedule of Deliverables
* Find some correlation between race and shootings. Estimated delivery date: 10/14/2020
* Interaction geo map distribution along with different states. Estimated delivery date: 10/28/2020 
* Explore some new visualization such as box plot. Estimated delivery date: 11/04/2020 
* Critique and summary the final project. Estimated delivery date: 11/11/2020

## Visualizations
* [Racism? All Lives Matter!](https://vizhub.com/Jogging97/fb6b037ada0c4f11a091505b35289632?file=index.html)
Recently, we have seen many cases with police killed black people inappropriately. So I tried to show the correlation between race and number of shootings.
From this chart we could see that the top 3 races are 'White', 'Black' and 'Hispanic'. Also the total number of shooting with 'White' people is almost two times than 'Black'. I think I may draw a conclusion that the racism may not so obvious but this data is recorded since 2015. Howeve, the racism may raise recently, we need to dive deeper to get more information before conclude that.
